          <p><strong>CVSS Score:&nbsp;</strong>4.3 MEDIUM</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Potential Impact:&nbsp;</strong>There is one known affected
            software configurations:

            <strong>Conditions:&nbsp;</strong>This script in the vulnerability
            demonstrates a technique for causing a simple stack overflow in a
            program if the user has Bloodshed Dev-C++ 4.9.9.2

          <p>
            In the Bloodshed Dev-C++ vulnerability, the script that is parsed
            allows user-assisted remote attackers to possibly execute arbitrary
            code in a .cpp file as well as forcing a stack-based buffer
            overflow. The way that this works is quite simple.

            What this code is basically doing is targeting the ASCII code
            '\x41', or the 'A' char, and overloading that with a string
            consisting of 80,000 A characters. This overflows that stack. It
            then opens a file named 'DevCpp.cpp' in 'wb' mode, or binary write
            mode - and then writes a large string to the file. This is a simple
            iteration of this technique, and this vulnerability is prone to
            cause a lot more harm than just this. In the file, the author
            writes, "I was unable to execute arbitrary code but I think someone
            better than me can successfully exploit it." This just means that it
            is definitely possible, the author simply couldn't figure it out.

            According to&nbsp;[<a
              href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2007-0643"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >nvd.nist.gov</a
            >], the vulnerability has been since modified, and is waiting
            reanalysis. This may change some information regarding this exploit.
            It is possible they figured out how to make it even more harmful.
            Though this exploit was for a now outdated program that had many
            issues, exploits like this still exist in many of our modern
            programs today. There are several ways that this has been mitigated
            on modern machines with current programs, but some of the logic
            still exists in a harmful way. For example, there are still programs
            that overflow memory stacks to crash the application. It might be in
            a different way that the way this script targeted - but it is still
            a common technique.

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Something I have found that is a common fix to attacks like this are
            something called "Stack Canaries." Basically, you make a known value
            between the local variable and the return address on the stack. This
            way, the program can determine if the value has been altered so we
            can see if there is a buffer overflow attack in place. In GCC, this
            is a built in function. You can use the '-fstack-protector' or
            '-fstack-protector-strong' to enable stack canaries.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            A great resource on this I have found is a post from [<a
              href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63024660/stack-corruption-detection-using-canary-value"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >Stack Overflow]</a
            >&nbsp;that illustrates the usage of Stack Canaries and the logic
            behind how it works.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            This research can be applied due to the new understanding of how
            buffer overflows work on a lower level, and how easy it can be to
            take advantage of the stacks without proper mitigation strategies.
            If possible, developers should try to add stack canaries to mitigate
            this, and can also use other forms of data validation before
            allowing alteration of important memory data, ensuring that we have
            done something to prevent DOS attacks for our users.
